# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Dashboard

This project is part of my **Excel Projects for Data Analytics** portfolio. It involves building an interactive dashboard to explore patterns in bike purchase decisions based on demographic and income-related variables.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze and visualize data in order to answer key business questions:

1. **Does income level affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?**
2. **Does commute distance to work influence the purchase decision?**

## 🔧 Tasks Performed

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Converted columns to appropriate data types:
  - Gender: Converted coded values to descriptive labels (e.g., `0` → `Female`).
  - Marital Status: Translated numerical values to `Single`, `Married`, etc.
  - Income: Applied Currency format.
  - Age: Grouped individual ages into brackets (e.g., `18–25`, `26–35`, `36–45`) using conditional formulas.

### 2. **Exploratory Analysis with Pivot Tables**
- Linked the dataset to a dedicated Pivot Table sheet.
- Created multiple pivot tables to analyze:
  - Average income vs. bike purchase status.
  - Gender distribution among buyers.
  - Purchase decision based on commute distance.

### 3. **Dashboard Creation**
- Built an interactive dashboard summarizing key insights.
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering:
  - Gender
  - Age Group
  - Commute Distance
  - Marital Status
- Enhanced user experience with clean layout and visual elements like charts and KPIs.
